    "description": "Accessibility is a broad descriptor generally misapplied to a narrow set of users. Every person has accessibility needs which evolve. It's not just a matter of empathy for those unfortunate enough to have a visible disability.

From basic technical connections between servers to interaction design, the web can either hinder or dramatically increase access to the rich information that everyone has a right to be able to access with comfort.",
