"Pathway Name","The Ability to Access"
"Pathway Description","Accessibility is a broad descriptor generally misapplied to a narrow set of users. Every person has accessibility needs which evolve. It's not just a matter of empathy for those unfortunate enough to have a visible disability. Accessible technologies are good technologies which benefit the able-bodied as much or more as the people they were designed to assist. Here is a selection of links which support that assertion."
