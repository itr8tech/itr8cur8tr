        <title>Step 1: Accessibility</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Objective:</strong> A broad but essential topic that should be considered in the early planning stages of any project and not treated as an afterthought. It takes more that passing some automated tests to have a good accessibility story. These resources will show you how.</p><ul><li><strong>A11Y Project</strong> (Required) - Read<br/>Learn the fundamentals and principles behind accessible design<br/><em>Context: Start here.</em><br/><a href="https://www.a11yproject.com">Launch</a></li><li><strong>Accessibility on Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</strong> (Required) - Read<br/>Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y — as in, &quot;a&quot;, then 11 characters, and then &quot;y&quot;) in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people&#039;s abilities are limited in some way.

For many people, technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, technology makes things possible. Accessibility means developing content to be as accessible as possible, no matter an individual&#039;s physical and cognitive abilities and how they access the web.

The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.

- Ponder your own accessibility issues. How do you take advantage of accommodations?</p>]]></description>
